# Minor TODOs and bugs for project DarkRealm

## **Unimplemented things**:

- two handed weapon animations (sheath, walk, unsheath)
- attack animations for the weapon types
- flame weapon effects for blue and green flame
- instantly equip chestplate armor type to mesh after using it in inventory (no extra input needed)
- gearscore -> tie it to enemies spawning near chests (3 good items == 150 gearscore, which is 3 +-1 enemies in the room)



## **Bugs**:

- pickup item order fix to camera (needs ui)
- bow in inventory -> walking backwards goes brrrr
- unsheath sword and shield -> change sword -> shield goes unsheathed
- cant unsheath shield alone (probably animations fault, game thinks its unsheathed)
- can unequip shield if drawn with sword

## **Extra TODOs**:

- find/make a base icon image for inventory/character UIs
- implement axe as right hand weapon
- copy BP_Fireball over to RedFlameLantern_BP
- implement bandage with the correct logic
- ui pop up of item name if looked at



## **Refactor**:
