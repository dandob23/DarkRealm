# Minor TODOs and bugs for project DarkRealm

## **Unimplemented things**:

- attack animations for the weapon types
- flame weapon effects for blue and green flame
- instantly equip chestplate armor type to mesh after using it in inventory (no extra input needed)
- gearscore -> tie it to enemies spawning near chests (3 good items == 150 gearscore, which is 3 +-1 enemies in the room)
- finish dagger animations and weapon type


## **Bugs**:

- bow in inventory -> walking backwards goes brrrr
- crouching animation blendspace
- arrows and ammunition work needed

## **Extra TODOs**:

- find/make a base icon image for inventory/character UIs
- implement axe as right hand weapon
- copy BP_Fireball over to RedFlameLantern_BP
- implement bandage with the correct logic

## **Refactor**:

BP_PLAYERCharacter -> Draw right, left, lantern weapon
